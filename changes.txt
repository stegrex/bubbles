Refactored the way rendering is done.

Class: Game
- Now contains an instance of class View.
- Render method now mapped to new View methods.
- The Game class should handle the data calculation side, but not too
much of the render logic.

Class: View (Formerly Render)
- The View class now contains an instance of ViewGraphics (formerly View).
- The purpose of the class is to provide an interface between the Game
and the Graphics.
- New methods simply pass the Game's object pool arrays to the
ViewGraphics object.

Class: ViewGraphics
- Handles the object pool by calling the Render class's methods to
return GeneralPaths to draw.

Class: Render
- Contains all the old Render class's methods.
- Uses render methods to return instances of GeneralPaths for the
ViewGraphics class to handle.
