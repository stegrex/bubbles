Main:
Instantiates GameLoop.

GameLoop:
Loads the Game.
Method loop() starts the main game timer (stole this from someone
else's blog), which calls the methods calculate() and render() from
Game.

Game:
Loads the Object Pools (arrays of objects). Currently loads two Blocks.
Method calculate() iterates each object's state in each Object Pool by
1 game frame, using the contextual methods in class Calculate.
Method render() generates a set of GeneralPaths for each object, using
the contextual render mapping methods in class Render.

Calculate:
Holds static methods for calculations and manipulations of object
states depending on object types.

Render:
Loads JFrame.
Holds game's JPanel.
Contains methods for clearing and repainting the JPanel (not sure how
this works, but I got it to work).
Holds methods for generating GeneralPaths (using any object type) into
the JPanel.

View:
Extends JPanel.
Provides some interfaces for accepting GeneralPaths from the outside.
Contains some other useful utilities for getting it to work.
