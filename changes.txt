Updated SlopedBlock calculation

Class: Calculate
- Edited method calculateBubbleSlopedBlock by adding calculation
bubbleSpeedRatio.
- Bubble speed ratio is defined by the slope's rise/(rise+run), so a
vertical line's ratio would be 1, horizontal line's ratio would be 0,
and line of slope 1 would have ratio of 0.5
- Calculation bubbleSpeedRatio is then multiplied to the horizontal
movement along the slope, which simulates slower movement when the
slope is more horizontal.
