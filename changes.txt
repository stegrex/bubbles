Not much different from before, but I made some modifications so that
bubbles can now be created.

Class: MouseInput
- Handles all of the mouse inputs.
- Instantiated at GameLoop and propagates through Render, into class
Render's static instance of the View (since JPanel uses the listener
and View is the JPanel in this case).
- On mouse button release, calls the Game class for its createBubble() method.

Class: Game
- Added method createBubble(). The method adds an instance of a Bubble
into the bubbles1 array (I haven't yet coded destructors so once 50
bubbles have been created, the array will be full).

Class: Calculate
- Added method calculateBubble() that calculates the new position of
any bubble and updates the object, per game frame.

Class: Render
- Added method renderBubble() that pushes the GeneralPath into the
view to be processed and drawn per frame.
