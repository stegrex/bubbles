Added methods for serializing the game pool into JSON.

Class: Game
- Added new save() method that will open a new save game, add the elements, then commit the save game.

Class: GameLevel
- Added new methods that accept arrays of game elements and serializes the elements into a JSON format that will make it easier to load the elements later.
- Typing key "s" will currently output the JSON into stdout for debugging.
- Eventually, the JSON string will be serialized into the savegames file where the game instances can be loaded.
