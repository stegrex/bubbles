Added the BubblesJSONObject and BubblesJSONParser classes to handle serialization/deserialization of game states into a subset of JSON for portable storage into files.

Class: GameLevel
- Added instance of BubblesJSONParser to read the levels file (JSON format) and parse into BubblesJSONObject data structures.
- Added handling and injection of game objects into the object pool using the JSON data from the levels file.

Class: BubblesJSONParser
- Completed parser class which reads in a string of JSON and can return BubblesJSONObject instances.

Class: BubblesJSONObject
- Data structure that holds instances of HashMap and ArrayList to handle JSON-based data dynamically, across different data types.
