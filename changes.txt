Added new GameEvent class for handling event queues. Preparation for refactoring.

Class: Game
- Added code for handling new GameEvent types.
- Moved Splash Demo Screen to be a GameEvent type.

Class: GameEvent
- Added new class.
- Not really multithreading, but allows for quick and easy way to schedule events that don't require extreme granularity (depends on whenever the game frame update picks it up).

Class: GamePool
- Added new class to get ready for refactoring anything related to the gamepool from the Game class.
